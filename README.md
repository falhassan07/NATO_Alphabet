# NATO Alphabet Program written in Python

The **NATO Alphabet** Program is a simple application designed to help users convert letters, words, or sentences into their NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents (e.g., "A" becomes "Alpha," "B" becomes "Bravo"). This tool is useful for improving communication clarity, especially in noisy environments or over radio transmissions. 


## Features:
1. Converts single letters, words, or entire sentences to the NATO phonetic alphabet.
2. Handles case-insensitivity (e.g., "a" and "A" both convert to "Alpha").
3. Ignores non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, symbols, etc.).
